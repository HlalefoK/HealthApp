# Goal
We are developing a health app that seamlessly integrates gamification principles, allowing users to effortlessly integrate it into their daily routines for health monitoring, education, and support.

Gamification has become a cornerstone in enhancing user engagement in software applications. By integrating gamification techniques into software development, we can elevate user experiences and increase enjoyment and promote regular use of the application.

We saw that there was a shortage/need for health apps that are both engaging and user-friendly.
